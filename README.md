# WebMesh Editor

A lightweight, in-browser editor for viewing, modifying, and creating simple Nastran (.dat, .bdf) finite element models. This tool is a single, self-contained HTML file with no server-side dependencies, making it easy to run offline or host on any static web server.

## Key Features

* **3D Visualization**: Interactively rotate, pan, and zoom complex finite element models in a 3D viewport.
* **File Support**: Load models by dragging and dropping .dat/.bdf files or using the file selector.
* **Model Creation**: Add new entities to your model, including:
* Nodes (GRID)
* Elements (CQUAD4, CTRIA3, CBAR, CBEAM, CBUSH, RBE2, RBE3)
* Coordinate Systems (CORD2R)
* Loads (FORCE, MOMENT) and Constraints (SPC1)
* **Interactive Editing**:
* Click to select nodes, elements, loads, and constraints.
* Use Alt+Drag for box selection.
* Edit node coordinates (local and global), element properties (PID, connectivity), and more through a detailed selection panel.
* **Advanced Coordinate Systems**: Full support for parsing, visualizing, creating, and exporting nested CORD2R local coordinate systems.
* **Display Customization**:
* Toggle visibility for individual element types, loads, constraints, and nodes.
* Switch color modes from default to property-based coloring.
* Adjust symbol sizes, background color, and shell opacity.
* Enable smooth shading for better depth perception.
* **Model Inspection**:
* View a hierarchical model tree with entity counts.
* Toggle labels for Node IDs, Element IDs, loads, and SPCs.
* Use the **Measure Tool** to see the distance and deltas between any two selected nodes.
* **Undo/Redo**: Full history support for all model modification actions.

### âœ¨ New Features in v0.80
* **Clipping Plane Tool:** Added a "Clipping" card to slice the model along XY, YZ, or XZ planes. Position can be set to a selected node, and the offset is adjustable with a slider or Ctrl+Mouse Wheel.
* **Label Culling:** Added a "Cull Labels" option (on by default) to intelligently hide overlapping labels and prevent visual clutter on dense models. The flickering issue has been resolved.
* **Collapsible Sidebar Panes:** All cards in the sidebar can now be collapsed and expanded to create a cleaner workspace.
* **Dynamic Camera Pivot:** Double-clicking anywhere on the model now sets the camera's rotation pivot point for more intuitive navigation.
* **Parallel View (Orthographic Camera):** The parallel projection camera mode is now fully functional.
* **Copy Node Coordinates:** Added a "Copy Selected Node Coords" button to the Add Node card for easier workflow.

## Future Development Roadmap
The current version provides a solid foundation for viewing and simple editing. The long-term vision is to evolve this tool into a more powerful, lightweight pre-processor. The following features are planned for future releases:

#### 1. Core Modeling & Meshing
* **3D Element Support:** Add parsing, rendering, and creation support for CHEXA, CPENTA, CTETRA, and CPYRA solid elements.
* **Advanced Meshing Tools:**
* **Translate/Copy:** Duplicate selections with a linear offset.
* **Radial Copy:** Duplicate selections around a center point and axis.
* **Reflect:** Mirror selections across a defined plane.
* **Mesh Refinement:** Subdivide existing shell elements to increase mesh density locally.
* **Node Merging:** A utility to find and merge duplicate nodes within a given tolerance.

#### 2. Visualization & User Interaction
* **Camera & View Controls:**
* ~~**Parallel Projection:** Implement an OrthographicCamera mode for checking alignments.~~ (Completed in v0.80)
* ~~**Dynamic Rotation Center:** Snap the camera's pivot point to the entity under the cursor or a selected node.~~ (Completed in v0.80)
* **Rendering Performance Optimizations:**
* **Instancing:** Use InstancedMesh for rendering nodes and other repeated symbols to dramatically improve performance on large models.
* ~~**Label Culling:** Implement an algorithm to prevent labels from overlapping, ensuring readability.~~ (Completed in v0.80)
* **Progressive Loading:** Use Web Workers to parse large files in the background without freezing the UI.

#### 3. User Interface & Experience (UI/UX)
* ~~**Collapsible Panes:** Allow sidebar sections to be collapsed to save space.~~ (Completed in v0.80)
* **Search & Filter:** Add a search bar to find entities by ID.
* **Model Groups/Layers:** Implement a system for users to create named groups of elements for easier visibility management.
* **Hotkeys:** Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions.

#### 4. Data & Compatibility
* **Full Property/Material Support:** Add UI panels and logic to create and edit PSHELL, PBAR, MAT1, etc.
* **Long-Format Support:** Implement import and export for 16-character field format cards.
* **Export Selection:** Allow exporting only the currently selected entities.
